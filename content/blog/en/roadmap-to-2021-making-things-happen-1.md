Hello! I'm thrilled to personally address (at least in written form) to all of you out there, our beloved Python community. 

2020 was indeed a challenging year. With a global pandemic and unprecedented circumstances worldwide, many had to adapt to virtuality as our primary way to work and communicate with others. From the Python side of the world in Vonage, we stand with you. 

2020 was also a year of many improvements for our SDKs and of a more prominent presence in the global community through conferences and various events in different latitudes.

In terms of our Communications API SDK, we are on a steady path to modularisation and supporting the latest and exciting features in Python 3.9 - 3.10. 
Our latest release includes support to both the "old" syntax with all methods in the client as we as the new syntax with standalone classes for SMS, Verify, and Voice. 
Future releases will only feature the new syntax, as we are advancing to deliver a strongly typed SDK for 2021.

For our Video API SDK, we have a lot of improvements in store. Better error handling, a strongly-typed SDK, and more modularisation are on the roadmap for 2021. 

We are excited and looking forward to all the advances and features to come. Make sure you stay tuned for more exciting news!

Most important, in terms of community, I personally want to thank you for your support, your contributions, and your feedback. It is a privilege and an honour to be part of a great ecosystem with so much support and engagement. I want to continue to foster an environment of collaboration and make you feel welcomed in our community at Vonage. 
Make sure to join our slack channel, where we can help with any questions you may have about our APIs and point you to our many resources!

2021 is the year of making things happen. From the Python side of the world at Vonage, I wish you all a happy new year and am looking forward to your valued feedback and contributions to our SDKs.

Let's make things happen together!
