# Introduction

In our previous post about [Vonage Joins Code Chrysalis API Hackathon](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/09/30/vonage-joins-code-chrysalis-api-night-hackathon/), we saw how Team Subarshi built an application called [CollabSpace](https://vonage-hackathon.herokuapp.com/) using [Vonage Video API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/) to make online team collaboration more interactive and simple for connecting with others and editing documents in real-time. That was all, right? Of course not. 

Within a few weeks following the hackathon, this group of Bootcamp students used the [Video API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/) to build another innovative project which was an e-learning web application called [Senpai](https://senpai-container-flsg4ziguq-uc.a.run.app/#/), for their Bootcamp Demo Day. In Japanese, the word Senpai refers to a teacher or master.

# What did they build?

Senpai

[Senpai](https://senpai-container-flsg4ziguq-uc.a.run.app/#/) is an e-learning web application that connects programming mentors and mentees. The website allows users interested in learning programming skills to find experienced front-end developers for 1-on-1 tutoring. It could also provide tutors with an opportunity to earn money as freelancers.

Built with:

* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Nodejs
* Docker
* [Vonage Video API](https://tokbox.com/developer/)

You can check out their [Application](https://senpai-container-flsg4ziguq-uc.a.run.app/#/) and see their code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Team-Subarashi/senpai). You can also view their [demo and presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HU8BrGvJQ).

![In the “Find a Senpai” page, you can see a list of Senpai when you set the filter to All](/content/blog/post-hackathon-the-e-learning-app-built-with-video-api/find-a-senpai.png "In the “Find a Senpai” page, you can see a list of Senpai when you set the filter to All")

# What makes it so special?

The idea behind Senpai was to create a platform for programmers to provide 1-on-1 tutorial services for people wanting to learn frontend technologies. The app was designed so that users would not have to constantly switch between multiple apps throughout the process, including those for scheduling, video chat, and screen sharing.

# Conclusion

I thought their project was a brilliant idea! I was impressed by what they have created using the [Video API](https://tokbox.com/developer/). Within a short time, they mastered the API and came up with a solution that streamlined the process of scheduling appointments, connecting people through video chat, screen sharing, and collaborating with one another all in one place. I can almost see how it can also be used in a virtual classroom, tuition centers, and distant learning in international schools.

# Want to know more?

You can learn more about our [Video API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/) and how the [video platform](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/basics/) works. Now, it is your turn to [get started](https://tokbox.com/developer/) build a project, or try out the [Video Express](https://tokbox.com/developer/video-express/) to create a multiparty video conferencing web application, without video expertise.

# Show us what you are working on

We are always interested in sharing your stories and new ways to use the Vonage APIs with the developer community. If you’ve built something with our APIs and think you’re ready to write about it, submit your article through our [Developer Spotlight Program](https://learn.vonage.com/spotlight/).
